# QEMU-RaspberryPi

Script to make it easy to emulate a Raspberry Pi 3 on MacOS (via qemu).

I found so much out of date, incorrect info out there when I tried to get this going so decided to put this together. Hopefully this is helpful to someone!

Tested on MacOS 11.0.1 with qemu installed via homebrew.

### Usage
`bash qemu-pi.sh`
